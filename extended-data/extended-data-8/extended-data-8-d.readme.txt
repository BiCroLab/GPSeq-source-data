Given the large size of the source data (26,855,000 data points), we provide here the location of the underlying data.

The radial position of all the beads from the 10,000 GPSeq-informed structures is available in the GEO repository with ID [GSE135882](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135882), in the file `GSE135882_chromflock.10000G.zip.gz`. The subcompartment labels were obtained from [this reference](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12954-4):
